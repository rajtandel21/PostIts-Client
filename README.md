## Technologies

* Figma
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Netlify
* Heroku


## Process

The project started with the analysis of the website requirements based on which a rough design was sketched using Figma. We then created a plan in a shared Google Docs file where we outlined what features we wanted to include, allocated a time frame for each one and logged our progress and remaining tasks.


After the planning and designing step, we worked on the initial HTML, Javascript and Server-side JavaScript by mob programming. This step ensured we had a basic functioning website before we split tasks and worked on specific features individually.

Everytime a new functioning feature was completed, its branch was merged to the Development branch and pushed to the main git repository. At the end all final changes were merged with the master branch.

## Wins & Challenges

Wins | Challenges
------------ | -------------
Improved understanding of Bootstrap and how to use it in combination with vanilla CSS. | The page layout was challenging to implement as the features were often unresponsive.
Succesfully posted gif and emoji data on the page and saved it on our server. | The Bootstrap and vanilla CSS styling would often override each other, creating confusion about the origin of the style.
Entered and stored new data into an external json file. | Creating the function that allowed us to post comments on the page and store them in a separate .json file.
Recorded a gif highlighting the website functionality and inserted it into the README file. | Hiding a responsive API key using a dotenv file.
